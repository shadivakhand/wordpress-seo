Skeleton loaders are designed to enhance user experience and minimize perceived loading times. They serve as a placeholder animation that replicates the structure of actual content while data is being fetched. It's an effective visual cue that reassures users that their interaction is acknowledged, even during loading processes. Whether utilized in lists, cards, or any other dynamic content, the skeleton loader maintains engagement by preventing a blank screen and conveying a sense of responsiveness. Skeleton loaders create a smoother and more polished experience for users, reducing frustration and maintaining user satisfaction while data is loading.
