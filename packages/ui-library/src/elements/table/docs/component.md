Tables are designed to efficiently organize and present data. They provide a structured layout that enables straightforward comprehension and interaction. With a variety of customizable features, they empower developers to craft dynamic and user-friendly interfaces for showcasing diverse types of information. Whether it's tabular data, lists, or grids, tables serve as powerful tools for enriching data visualization and user experience.

A table comprises subcomponents that enable table construction. It includes `Table.Head` and `Table.Body` as child components.
