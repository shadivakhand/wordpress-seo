Error boundaries are designed to handle and manage errors. (Also see: https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary.)

The purpose of the error boundary is to enhance the user experience by:
- Preventing the application from crashing due to uncaught errors.
- Providing a fallback UI or error message to users when errors occur.
- Facilitating better error handling and debugging for developers.

When an error occurs within the child components of an error boundary, the following UX considerations should be taken into account:
- **Error message**: Write a user-friendly error message that informs the user about the encountered error. Consider providing clear and concise instructions, error details (if applicable), and a way to recover or take appropriate action if possible.
- **Error logging**: Include error logging functionality within the error boundary to capture error details for debugging purposes. Developers should be able to access these logs easily and efficiently for troubleshooting and issue resolution.
