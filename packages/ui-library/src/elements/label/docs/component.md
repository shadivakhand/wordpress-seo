Labels are textual elements used in user interfaces to provide descriptive information and context for UI elements like text inputs, selects, toggles, radio buttons, and checkboxes and more. The objective of using labels is to provide clear and meaningful information to users, ensuring they understand the purpose of the associated elements and enabling them to interact effectively with the interface.
