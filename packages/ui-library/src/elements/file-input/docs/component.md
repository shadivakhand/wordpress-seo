File inputs with drag and drop functionality are user interface elements that allow users to upload local files.
They provide an intuitive and convenient way for users to interact with the system by simply dragging and dropping
files from their local machine into the designated area.
The API of the `FileInput` elements resembles that of both a `<file type="input">`
and an element with drag-and-drop behaviour with an `onDrop` callback.
