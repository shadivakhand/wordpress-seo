Code-formatted blocks are visual elements used to display and format sections of text or code snippets in a way that differentiates them from regular text.

The purpose of using a code-formatted block is to:
- Distinguish code or technical content from regular text, making it easily recognizable for developers, technical users, or anyone reading or referencing the content.
- Preserve the formatting and structure of the code, including indentation, line breaks, and syntax highlighting, to ensure accuracy and clarity.
- Improve readability by using a monospaced font and applying appropriate styling to differentiate code elements such as keywords, variables, and comments.
