Spinners are visual elements used to indicate that a process or task is in progress. The purpose of a spinner is to provide visual feedback to users that a process is ongoing, helping to manage their expectations and reduce frustration caused by waiting for a response or action to complete.

Spinners are commonly used in various scenarios, including:
- **Data loading:** Indicating that data is being fetched or retrieved from a server.
- **Form submission:** Showing that a form is being submitted and processed.
- **Content loading:** Signifying that content, such as images or videos, is being loaded or rendered.
